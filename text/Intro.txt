It is a post 2021 cypto bull market apocalypse. Many survivors are left hodling bags of **_down bad_**:chart_with_downwards_trend: NFTs and cryptocurrenices. This article will provide you the knowledge and wherewithal to survive the 2022 crypto bear market and thrive in the next installment of **_CRYPTO BULL RUN_**.

Over the past year, I have noticed a trend in NFTs that almost all older projects have been on a downtrend while almost all new projects pump. Without looking into it at all, I chalked it up to public hyping the shiny new and dumping the dusty old. Now that we are clearly in the middle of the dreaded bear market, I decided to go deeper.

**Do exisiting crypto projects pump to new all time highs during the next bull market?**

To answer this question, first let us take a look at how the crypto space has evolved. Of course the space was born with the creation of BTC by the almight lord himself, Satoshi. Not long afterwords, people began forking BTC to create new projects like Litcoin and Doge. Prior to USDT entering the crypto space, all crypto tokens and assets were denominated in BTC. The arrival of USDT changed this practice as most crypto tokens are now denominated in USD. With the rapid growth and popularity of NFTs in 2021 another change occurred where most NFTs are denominated by ETH. For this research topic, I have chosen to return to denominating all asset prices in BTC. 

Since BTC is the oldest assest in the space, each of the assests analyzed can be priced in terms of BTC at all points in their development. We will look at how the assets perform during the early stages, initial hype cycle, crypto bear markets, and crypto bull markets. The advantage that BTC denomination provides, is that we can identify when the assests generally outperform BTC and when they generally do not outperform BTC. In my opinion, this allows us to distinguish assets increasing in USD price due to general crypto bull market versus the projects own merits.

Lastly, please note that I am writing this assuming that most cryptocurrencies participants are not skilled enough to be traders. This strategy is aimed at those planning to hold for long periods of time (5+ years).
